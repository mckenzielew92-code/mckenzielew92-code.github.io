             </h3>
            <p>
                World Market used the <b>visual hierarchy</b> design principle 
                well in their site.  You can see that the thing that draws your
                eye is the: <i>50% off rugs sale!</i>  They accomplish this by making 
                the box stand out against everything else with a bright red color and
                making the box very large.

            <p>
                Old Navy did a good job at exemplifying the <b>contrast</b> 
                design principle. The contrasting colors they chose were
                gold, white, navy blue, and a torquoise green.  When put side
                by side it's easily read and compliment eachother.

            </h3>
            <p>
                Disney uses the <b>Hick's Law</b> design principle by
                making their site very plain and simple as soon as it
                is pulled up by the browser.  There is only a few links
                to click on and not much to read. It makes the decision to
                buy tickets easy with the button easily visible and accessible.
