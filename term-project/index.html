                <p><span class="first-letter">T</span>he Newport temple was announced in April of 2001, and was
                    dedicated in August of 2005. Members of the Church of Jesus Christ living particularly in Orange
                    County were pleased to have a temple that they could get to within the hour. Prior to the Newport
                    Beach Temple being built, the closest temple was either the Los Angeles, or the San Diego temple.
                    Both temples being about a 2 hour drive one way. Having one close makes it easier for local families
                    to make frequent visits and they couldn't be more grateful to have multiple temples so close to
                    them.</p>

        <p id="newport-p">The Newport temple had to be a shade of light tan because of it's location. The city would not
            let a
            white temple be built as it would not fit in the community. In order to build a temple the church
            agreed to paint the outside to work with the local city's color scheme.</p>
